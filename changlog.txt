TODO:
- Clear the prompt text, by removing text within brackets.
- fix "no results". should be added when all the results we get are shity.
- sometimes all the nzbs have a small number of missing files. should add those anyway, but display how many missing.
- should manually check for "password protected, instead of "Require NFO"
